API Reference
=============

The API reference is automatically generated from the docstrings in the code, and is useful for
finding out what methods and attributes are available for a given class. The API reference is
divided into several sections, each of which is listed below.

At a Glance
-----------

- Start with ``reference/index`` to discover modules and top-level APIs.
- Inertia has a dedicated reference section under ``reference/inertia``.
- Private APIs are intentionally omitted.

.. note:: Private methods and attributes are not included in the API reference.
